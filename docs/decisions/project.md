# Decisions — project

How the repo is set up, and the contract it keeps with Pitchboard.

Every decision here was measured before it was made. They are kept because the code
cites them by number, and because the failures are worth as much as the successes.

**D1 — sibling repo, not `pitchboard/tools/`.** Pitchboard is strict TypeScript with a pure
engine and tight conventions. A Python venv, model weights and a CUDA-shaped dependency tree
inside it costs more than colocation is worth. The two repos meet at a file.

**D2 — Python pinned to 3.12.** The machine has 3.14. Torch, ultralytics and the OCR stack
all lag new releases by months; starting on 3.14 means an evening of build errors instead of
an evening of CV.

**D3 — `tracks.json` is the contract, and it is frozen before the CV works.** It is the one
artefact two repos share. Fixing it early lets the TypeScript reduction be written in
parallel against fixtures, and it means the entire video pipeline can be replaced — by a
different tracker, by a hand-annotation tool, by a vendor's data — without touching
Pitchboard.

**D6 — SoccerNet first.** It is broadcast footage published with calibration and tracking
ground truth, so "70%" becomes a number you measure rather than a feeling you have about a
video. Arbitrary clips only once the numbers are known.

**D9 — Ultralytics YOLO is AGPL-3.0.** Fine for a local proof that ships nothing. A problem
the moment this graduates into a product. RT-DETR and RF-DETR are Apache-licensed and are the
swap to make if that day comes — which is another reason the detector lives behind a stage
boundary and not in the middle of everything.

**D10 — SoccerNet enters at stage 1.** Its clips are single-camera JPEG sequences with no
cuts in them, so stage 0 has nothing to do on this path. Stage 0 is not dead code: it is
what the arbitrary-broadcast path needs, and that is the case this has to work on
eventually. But it must not sit in SoccerNet's way, and no later stage may assume it ran.

**D11 — a clip is fetched by range request, never a split download.** The zip index is at
the end of the file and HuggingFace serves ranges, so one clip costs ~150 MB against the
split's 8.85 GB. Members are read in header order rather than name order, which turns 750
random reads into a near-sequential scan.

**D12 — ground truth is written through the same writer as the CV path.** `ft truth` builds
`Track` objects and hands them to `tracks.write`, exactly as stage 4 will. Two consequences,
both wanted: the contract is exercised by real data before any vision exists, and every
later stage is scored by diffing two files of the same shape. A separate ground-truth
format would have made the comparison a translation exercise, which is where a scoring
harness quietly starts measuring itself.

**D14 — ground truth is `truth.json`, a prediction is `tracks.json`.** The same format
written by the same writer, given two names so that a stage cannot overwrite the yardstick
it is about to be measured against. `ft score` defaults to the `truth.json` beside its
argument.

**D15 — the scorecard separates the failures the averages hide.** Recall cannot see an
identity switch: a tracker that swaps two players halfway through still finds everybody, so
purity and the switch count are reported beside it. And a wrong shirt number is reported
apart from an unread one, because they are not the same mistake — unread imports as a
generic token and costs nothing, wrong attaches a run to the wrong player where no one
downstream can see it (D5). A single "jersey accuracy" percentage would average the free
error together with the expensive one.
